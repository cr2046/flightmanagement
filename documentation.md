## SQL Query Analysis

### 1. Flight Retrieval Queries

#### Complex Flight Search with Multiple Joins
```sql
SELECT f.flight_number, o.destination_name as origin, d.destination_name as destination,
       p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as pilot, f.departure_time, f.arrival_time, f.status
FROM Flights f
JOIN Destinations o ON f.origin_id = o.destination_id
JOIN Destinations d ON f.destination_id = d.destination_id
LEFT JOIN Pilots p ON f.pilot_id = p.pilot_id
ORDER BY f.departure_time;
```

**How it works:**
- Uses INNER JOINs to connect flights with origin and destination details
- Uses LEFT JOIN for pilots to include flights without assigned pilots
- String concatenation creates full pilot names
- ORDER BY clause sorts results chronologically

**Why it's used:** Provides comprehensive flight information in a single query, essential for flight listing and scheduling operations.

#### Flight Filtering by Destination
```sql
SELECT f.flight_number, o.destination_name as origin, d.destination_name as destination,
       p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as pilot, f.departure_time, f.arrival_time, f.status
FROM Flights f
JOIN Destinations o ON f.origin_id = o.destination_id
JOIN Destinations d ON f.destination_id = d.destination_id
LEFT JOIN Pilots p ON f.pilot_id = p.pilot_id
WHERE f.destination_id = ?
ORDER BY f.departure_time;
```

**How it works:** Filters flights by specific destination using parameterized queries for security
**Why it's used:** Enables destination-specific flight searches for operational planning and customer inquiries.

#### Date Range Flight Search
```sql
SELECT f.flight_number, o.destination_name as origin, d.destination_name as destination,
       p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as pilot, f.departure_time, f.arrival_time, f.status
FROM Flights f
JOIN Destinations o ON f.origin_id = o.destination_id
JOIN Destinations d ON f.destination_id = d.destination_id
LEFT JOIN Pilots p ON f.pilot_id = p.pilot_id
WHERE DATE(f.departure_time) BETWEEN ? AND ?
ORDER BY f.departure_time;
```

**How it works:** Uses DATE() function to extract date part and BETWEEN operator for range filtering
**Why it's used:** Critical for schedule planning and operational reports within specific timeframes.

### 2. Reporting and Analytics Queries

#### Flights per Destination Report
```sql
SELECT d.destination_name, COUNT(f.flight_id) as flight_count
FROM Destinations d
LEFT JOIN Flights f ON d.destination_id = f.destination_id
GROUP BY d.destination_id, d.destination_name
ORDER BY flight_count DESC;
```

**How it works:**
- LEFT JOIN ensures all destinations appear even with zero flights
- COUNT() aggregates flight numbers per destination
- GROUP BY creates destination-based groupings
- ORDER BY ranks destinations by flight frequency

**Why it's used:** Provides business intelligence on route popularity and network utilization.

#### Pilot Workload Analysis
```sql
SELECT p.first_name || ' ' || p.last_name as pilot_name, COUNT(f.flight_id) as flight_count
FROM Pilots p
LEFT JOIN Flights f ON p.pilot_id = f.pilot_id
GROUP BY p.pilot_id, pilot_name
ORDER BY flight_count DESC;
```

**How it works:** Aggregates flight assignments per pilot to analyze workload distribution
**Why it's used:** Essential for workforce management and ensuring equitable pilot scheduling.

#### Busiest Routes Analysis
```sql
SELECT o.destination_name || ' → ' || d.destination_name as route, COUNT(*) as count
FROM Flights f
JOIN Destinations o ON f.origin_id = o.destination_id
JOIN Destinations d ON f.destination_id = d.destination_id
GROUP BY route
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**How it works:**
- Creates route strings by concatenating origin and destination names
- Groups identical routes and counts occurrences
- LIMIT restricts results to top 10 busiest routes

**Why it's used:** Identifies high-traffic routes for capacity planning and resource allocation.

### 3. Data Modification Queries

#### Flight Updates
```sql
UPDATE Flights SET departure_time = ? WHERE flight_number = ?;
UPDATE Flights SET status = ? WHERE flight_number = ?;
UPDATE Flights SET pilot_id = ? WHERE flight_id = ?;
```

**How it works:** Parameterized UPDATE statements modify specific flight attributes
**Why it's used:** Enables real-time schedule adjustments and operational status updates.

#### Pilot Assignment
```sql
UPDATE Flights SET pilot_id = ? WHERE flight_id = ?;
```

**How it works:** Updates foreign key reference to assign pilots to flights
**Why it's used:** Critical for crew scheduling and operational assignments.

### 4. Data Insertion Queries

#### Sample Data Population
```sql
INSERT INTO Destinations (destination_name, country, airport_code, timezone)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?);

INSERT INTO Pilots (first_name, last_name, license_number, experience_years, hire_date)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?);

INSERT INTO Flights (flight_number, origin_id, destination_id, pilot_id, departure_time, arrival_time, status, aircraft_type, capacity)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?);
```

**How it works:** Parameterized INSERT statements add new records with data validation
**Why it's used:** Enables system expansion and operational data entry.
